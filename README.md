**DL-based Pneumonia Detection**

Deep learning–based object detection system for identifying pneumonia opacities in chest X-ray images.
This project was developed as part of the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge, using RetinaNet with a ResNet-101 backbone to detect and localize pneumonia regions in DICOM X-rays.

Project Overview:
Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection and a leading cause of mortality worldwide.
Manual diagnosis using X-rays is time-intensive and prone to variability.
We built a RetinaNet object detector that automates pneumonia detection, reduces clinical workload, and enables faster, more consistent diagnosis.

⚙️ Methodology
Model Architecture

Backbone: ResNet-101 pre-trained on ImageNet

Feature Pyramid Network (FPN): Multi-scale feature extraction

Anchors: 5 scales × 3 aspect ratios (0.5, 1.0, 2.0)

Loss: Focal Loss (classification) + Smooth L1 (bounding box regression)

Optimizer: AdamW (lr=5e-5, weight decay=1e-4)

Scheduler: StepLR (decay factor 0.5 every 10 epochs)

Early Stopping: Patience = 7 epochs

Dataset

Source: RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge (Kaggle)

Training: 26,684 chest X-rays (6,012 with pneumonia annotations)

Split: 80% training, 20% validation

Image Size: Resized to 768×768 for GPU efficiency

Preprocessing: DICOM → grayscale, normalized to [0,1], converted to PyTorch tensors

📊 Results

mAP@0.5: 0.6205

Recall@100: 0.7614

Validation Loss: ~0.71 (best model)

Visualization: Bounding boxes drawn on predictions (green = model, red = ground truth)

The model demonstrated strong generalization on unseen X-rays, successfully detecting pneumonia-related opacities.
